# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-Diagnostic-Data-Set
The columns in  breast cancer dataset represent various features that are commonly used to describe characteristics of tumors. These features can be measured from images of breast tissue and are helpful in determining whether a tumor is cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Let me explain each of these features:

1. **Radius:** The average distance from the center of the tumor to its boundary.

2. **Texture:** The standard deviation of gray-scale values in the image, representing the variation in pixel intensity.

3. **Perimeter:** The total length of the boundary of the tumor.

4. **Area:** The total area covered by the tumor.

5. **Smoothness:** A measure of the smoothness of the tumor boundary.

6. **Compactness:** Describes how compact the shape of the tumor is, calculated as (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0).

7. **Concavity:** The severity of concave portions of the tumor.

8. **Concave Points:** The number of concave portions of the tumor.

9. **Symmetry:** Symmetry of the tumor.

10. **Fractal Dimension:** A measure of the complexity of the tumor boundary.
